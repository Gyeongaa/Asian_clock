## Usage
Open the terminal and change the current working directory to the one where the repository is installed. Run python main.py in the terminal.

An interactive GUI window will pop up, displaying an Asian map with flags marking five Asian countries. Next to each country, there is a button that the user can click on. When a button with the country's name is clicked, the clock will tell the current time in that country in its language.

On the left side of the window, the current time in Singapore is shown by default. Below the time, there are two slider bars that allow users to adjust the speaking rate (0-2) and volume (0-1) of the audio according to their preferences. There is also a 'Toggle Mode' button that lets users switch to different modes.

In the lower-left corner, there is a 'Set Custom Alarm' button, which allows users to set alarm times in one of the five Asian timezones to remind themselves of specific tasks. After the alarm is set, a text with the format 'Alarm Alarm_name: year-month-date hour-minute-second AM/PM is set' is diaplayed.
